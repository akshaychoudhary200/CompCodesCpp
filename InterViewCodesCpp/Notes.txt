Taking inputs:

while taking inputs if inputs stops after taking one or two input check for formated and unformated input
for ex 
getline()     //unformated
cin>>         //formated

string <space> number <newline>

jab string k bad number input karengy to next input k time first input <newline> rahega. unformated input 
bad k whitespace remove ni krta jbki formated input k bad <newline> consider krta h to jb second input line rahegi
getline() and cin kuch b read ni kr paengy qki first input <newline> rahega to input stream failed stream me rahega
to hr input k bas <newline> ka buffer clear kre k liye cin.get() use krna padega.

>> formated it excludes white space and count them as termination point
get() unforated it includes white space

to >> isk bad input mtlb buffer me <newline>


formatted skips all the whitespace before reading input but will stop at first whitespace after reading the input
and while reading integar it will also stop if the data type is incorrect like char inplace of integar so after reading it
in buffer tha last thing would be <newline> in the next loop the first thing would be read will be <newline> so to avoid this
we need to read that <newline> so to read <newline> we have to use cin.get(); so <newline> in buffer will be read.
